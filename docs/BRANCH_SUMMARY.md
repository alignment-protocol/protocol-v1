# `implement-topic-structure` Branch Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Topic/Corpus Organization

- ✅ Created `Topic` struct for organizing submissions by topic area
- ✅ Implemented `create_topic` instruction for protocol authorities
- ✅ Created `SubmissionTopicLink` struct for many-to-many relationships
- ✅ Implemented `submit_data_to_topic` instruction for topic-specific submissions

### 2. Voting Mechanism (Commit-Reveal)

- ✅ Created `VoteChoice` enum for Yes/No voting
- ✅ Created `VoteCommit` struct for commit phase
- ✅ Added voting phase timing for each submission within a topic
- ✅ Implemented `commit_vote` instruction with hash storage
- ✅ Implemented `reveal_vote` instruction with hash verification
- ✅ Added quadratic voting power (sqrt of token amount)
- ✅ Support for both temporary and permanent reputation tokens

### 3. Finalization

- ✅ Added `finalize_submission` to determine acceptance based on votes
- ✅ Implemented token conversion from tempAlign to Align for contributors
- ✅ Added `finalize_vote` for validator rewards/penalties
- ✅ Implemented token conversion from tempRep to Rep for correct validators
- ✅ Added slashing (burning tempRep) for incorrect votes

### 4. Security Features

- ✅ Added permissions to allow anyone to call finalize_vote (not just validators)
- ✅ Added voting time window enforcement
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling

## Still To Be Implemented

### 1. Cross-Topic Submission Linking

- ❌ Allow linking existing submissions to additional topics after initial validation
- ❌ Add a new instruction to create these links

### 2. Testing

- ❌ Unit tests for staking functionality
- ❌ Unit tests for voting mechanisms (commit and reveal)
- ❌ Unit tests for finalization logic
- ❌ Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

### 3. Advanced Features

- ❌ Reputation token tracking by topic
- ❌ Partial burn for permanent Rep tokens
- ❌ Batch processing for vote finalizations
- ❌ Escrow-based approach for temporary tokens

## Architecture Decisions

### Topics and Submissions

- Submissions are created first, then linked to topics
- Each submission within a topic has its own voting window
- Submissions can potentially exist in multiple topics (future enhancement)

### Voting

- Two-phase commit-reveal to prevent collusion
- Quadratic voting with tempRep or Rep tokens
- Anyone can finalize votes, not just the validator

### Token Conversion

- tempAlign → Align conversion for accepted submissions
- tempRep → Rep conversion for correct votes
- tempRep burning for incorrect votes
- No permanent Rep penalties in MVP

## Future Optimization Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**: Add ability to process multiple vote finalizations at once
2. **Escrow-based Approach**: Lock tokens during voting and auto-convert/burn after finalization
3. **Topic-specific Reputation**: Track and enforce tempRep usage only within topics where it was earned
