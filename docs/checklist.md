- 🔴 High Priority
- 🟠 Medium Priority
- 🟢 Low Priority

## 1. Initialize Protocol & Token Mints

- ✅ Create `State` account (PDA)

- 🟢 ❌ Add support for eventual DAO governance

## 2. Submit Data & Mint tempAlign Tokens

- ✅ Create `Submission` account with contributor and data reference
- ✅ Mint tokens to contributor upon submission
- ✅ Create user token accounts (ATAs) as needed
- 🟠 ❌ Enforce data validation or size limits
- 🟢 ❌ Add optional spam prevention mechanism
- ✅ Store data on-chain (current approach)
- 🟢 ❌ Add support for off-chain data storage links (IPFS/Arweave) - Future enhancement

## 3. Stake tempAlign Tokens for tempRep

- ✅ Create `UserProfile` account to track reputation
- ✅ Implement `stake_alignment_tokens` instruction to convert tempAlign to tempRep
- 🟠 ❌ Add staking period/lockup functionality

## 4. Commit & Reveal Votes

- ✅ Implement two-phase voting process
- ✅ Create data structures for commit phase (hashed votes)
- ✅ Create data structures for reveal phase
- ✅ Add time windows or epochs for commit/reveal phases
- ✅ Add verification of commit hash during reveal
- ✅ Update submission vote counters during reveal
- ✅ Handle edge cases (missed reveals, late votes)

## 5. Finalize Submission & Convert Temporary Tokens to Permanent Tokens

- ✅ Implement finalization logic to determine submission acceptance
- ✅ Add vote tallying mechanisms
- ✅ Convert contributor's tempAlign tokens to Align tokens for accepted submissions
- ✅ Convert correct validators' tempRep to Rep tokens
- ✅ Implement slashing for incorrect votes (burn tempRep)
- ✅ Update submission status (Accepted/Rejected)

## Hackathon Implementation Plan (3 Days Remaining)

### Day 1: Diagram Creation & Documentation ✅

- ✅ Create token flow diagram using Mermaid:
  - ✅ tempAlign → tempRep → permanent token conversion
  - ✅ Voting power and staking relationships
  - ✅ Acceptance/rejection token flows
- ✅ Create revenue sharing diagram using Mermaid:
  - ✅ Corpus-specific vs platform revenue
  - ✅ Distribution percentages by participant type
  - ✅ Corpus shares attribution
- ✅ Create protocol workflow diagram:
  - ✅ Visualize end-to-end process flow
  - ✅ Show participant interactions
