# Changes in Branch: implement-cross-topic-linking

## Overview

This branch implements cross-topic submission linking for the Alignment Protocol. This feature allows submissions to be linked to multiple topics, enabling more flexible organization and voting across different domains.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Cross-Topic Submission Linking

- Added LinkSubmissionToTopic account struct
- Implemented link_submission_to_topic instruction
- Ensured proper voting phase setup for linked submissions
- Maintained topic-specific vote tallies

### 2. Error Handling

- Added NotAuthorizedToLinkSubmission error code
- Made linking functionality available to any user who pays for the transaction

## Design Decisions

- Each topic link maintains its own independent voting state
- A submission can have different outcomes (accepted/rejected) in different topics
- No additional token minting happens when linking an existing submission
- Simplified UX by allowing anyone to create links

## Benefits

- Allows contributors to get feedback from multiple domains
- Enables cross-domain collaboration and validation
- Increases submission visibility
- Supports multi-disciplinary content that spans several topics

## Previous Work

Built on top of the topic-structure implementation which included:

- Topic struct for organizing submissions by category
- SubmissionTopicLink for many-to-many relationships
- Two-phase commit-reveal voting mechanism
- Token conversion systems for accepted submissions

## Next Steps

- Implement topic-specific reputation tracking
- Create tests for cross-topic voting and finalization
- Enhance UI to show submission relationships across topics
